# Javelo - Biking Companion 

**Javelo** is a Java application specially crafted to enrich your cycling experience in Switzerland. 
Just like Google Maps guides you on the road, JaVelo serves as your trusted cycling companion. It enables you to **visualize cycling routes, gradients, and descents in Switzerland**, enhancing your cycling adventures with convenience and organization. 
JaVelo employs **the  Astar algorithm for route calculations** and harnesses the power of **JavaFX and OpenStreetMap** to deliver a user-friendly experience.

## Contributions 

The whole code is authentic, but the class "ElevationProfileManager" was lost. Thank you to Pedro Afonso Gouveia and Idriss Mimet for allowing me to use their function.
Feel free to submit suggestings and issues!
